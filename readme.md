```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/porteta/underware.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies and check to see it works. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn run dev      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```
